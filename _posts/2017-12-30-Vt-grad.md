title: Virginia Tech Graduation Feature
---

After 3.5 years, a couple days ago I walked across the stage in Cassell Collisuem to receive my degree in Statistics with a double major in Computational Modeling and Data Analytics. It was an absolutely transformative and amazing experience at Virginia Tech. I was honored to have been featured in the Virginia Tech Class of 2017 graduation series. The article can be found [here](https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2017/12/121417-dsa-ginthergradprofile.html). Courageous leadership is nothing without courageous leaders. I am truly grateful for everyone who believed in my leadership and allowed me to have the opportunities I had.
